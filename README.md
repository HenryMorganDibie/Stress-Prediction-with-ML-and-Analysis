### Stress-Prediction-with-ML-and-Analysis
This dataset provides valuable insights into the mental health, relationships, and abuse-related issues faced by people in our society. Through this analysis, we have identified patterns and insights that can help in better understanding these issues and how technology can be used to identify and address them. I have used various techniques such as feature selection, model selection, performance evaluation, and error analysis to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the label based on the given text and other features. I hope that this analysis can be used to develop better tools and solutions that can help people who are facing these issues and improve their lives.
# Summary of the process:

* Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
* Performed some basic exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizing the distribution of labels and sentiment scores.
* Preprocessed the text data by cleaning it, removing stop words, and engineering new features such as word frequency and sentiment score using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
* Split the data into training and testing sets and used scikit-learn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors.
* Trained a RandomForestClassifier on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Then I performed an error analysis to gain insights into the model's misclassifications, including looking at misclassified examples, examining feature importance, correlation analysis, and performance metrics.
* Based on the insights gained from the error analysis, we made improvements to the model by adjusting the feature selection or engineering new features.
