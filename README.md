## Stress-Prediction-with-ML-and-Analysis
# Summary of the process:

Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
Performed some basic exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizing the distribution of labels and sentiment scores.
Preprocessed the text data by cleaning it, removing stop words, and engineering new features such as word frequency and sentiment score using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
Split the data into training and testing sets and used scikit-learn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors.
Trained a RandomForestClassifier on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
We then performed an error analysis to gain insights into the model's misclassifications, including looking at misclassified examples, examining feature importance, correlation analysis, and performance metrics.
Based on the insights gained from the error analysis, we made improvements to the model by adjusting the feature selection or engineering new features.
